description: There is a well-known saying that the whole of Western Philosophy is
  footnotes of Plato. This is because his writings have set the schema that philosophy
  can be said to have followed ever since. Following under the teachings of Socrates,
  Plato's works are among the world's greatest literature. Cratylus is of opinion
  that a name is either a true name or not a name at all. He is unable to conceive
  of degrees of imitation; a word is either the perfect expression of a thing, or
  a mere inarticulate sound. Of the real Cratylus we know nothing, except that he
  is recorded by Aristotle to have been the friend or teacher of Plato.
